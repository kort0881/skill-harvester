# Functional Skill Creator

> **Maintain Agent Skills with functional programming discipline.**

[中文版 README](docs/README.zh-CN.md)

Functional Skill is an engineering methodology, **designed for complex Skill maintenance and iteration.**
Combined with trace logging and unit testing, it makes Skills **modular, traceable, and testable**:

- Treat each `Step` as a `Function` with explicit `Input/Output` (pure function first)
- `SKILL.md` only orchestrates the pipeline of `Function`s, consuming only `external inputs` and `reference dependencies`
- Shared rules across `Function`s go into `references/`
- Deterministic logic called by `Function`s becomes `scripts/`
- Add trace logging for every `Function`, running locally, recording input/output/token consumption/duration
- Equip every `Function` with unit tests and E2E tests, ensuring neither individual Functions nor the full pipeline regress

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npx skills add AGI-comming/functional-skill-creator --skill fskill-creator -y
```

Install via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/). Add `-a <agent>` to target one agent; add `-g` only if it supports global install.

---

### Usage

**Create** — new functional skill from a workflow brief:

```text
/fskill-creator create a functional skill for <workflow>
```

**Migrate** — convert an existing legacy skill directory into a functional skill:

```text
/fskill-creator migrate <path-to-skill-dir>
```

The migrate lane reads the whole skill package — `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, and other companion files — not a single markdown file in isolation.

Optional: `include_report`, `include_unittest`, `include_viewers` (on by default; set to `false` to skip).

## Why

Your Skill is getting bloated.

As your Skill's capabilities iterate, your `SKILL.md` and `references/*.md` grow longer, rules pile up, edge cases get patched ever more finely — slowly turning into an unmaintainable wall of prose.

A typical example is when everything keeps getting stuffed into a handful of markdown files:

### Before: monolithic prose wall

Functional Skill Creator provides an engineering methodology that makes Skills **modular, traceable, and testable**:

- Break each step into a `Function` with explicit Input/Output
- `SKILL.md` only orchestrates the pipeline of `Function`s, consuming only `external inputs` and `reference dependencies`
- Shared rules across `Function`s go into `references/`
- Deterministic logic called by `Function`s becomes `scripts/`
- Add trace logging for every `Function`, running locally, recording input/output/token consumption/duration
- Equip every `Function` with unit tests and E2E tests, ensuring neither individual Functions nor the full pipeline regress

### After: observable functional pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph exec["execution — compose(f₄ ∘ f₃ ∘ f₂ ∘ f₁)"]
    direction LR
    ORCH["SKILL.md<br/>orchestration only"] --> F1["f₁ load_input<br/>(raw) → loaded"] --> F2["f₂ extract<br/>(loaded) → req"] --> F3["f₃ generate<br/>(req) → plan"] --> F4["f₄ validate<br/>(plan) → out"]
  end

  subgraph sup["supporting layers — read-only dependencies"]
    direction LR
    REF["references/"] --- SCR["scripts/"] --- TC["testcases/"] --- LOG["logs/runs/"]
  end

Functional Skill does not aim to make Skills complex, but to put complexity where it belongs: judgment goes to Functions, rules go into references, deterministic actions go to scripts, and regression behavior solidifies into testcases.

## When to Use

- You are maintaining a long-evolving agent skill and don't want to rely on gut feeling for every regression check.
- Your `SKILL.md` and `references/` have become impossible to maintain manually, leaving you no choice but to blindly let AI iterate down one path.
- You want to extract deterministic work like parsing, formatting, and validation from prompts and execute them reliably through scripts.
- You want your skill's functionality and execution flow to become traceable, so you can pinpoint exactly where each run went wrong.
- You want your skill to capture real failure cases and ideal runs, turning them into repeatable test suites.

In other words, if your Skill is concise, or you've already split it cleanly in a modular way and are confident it's maintainable — you don't need to make it Functional.

## Report Log and Unittest Capabilities

Skills generated by `fskill-creator` include basic report / unittest tooling by default. Use `include_report=false` and `include_unittest=false` to disable them separately, or use `include_viewers=true|false` to control whether local viewers are generated.

- `scripts/report.mjs`: Writes function-level report logs, supports `report_mode=off|local|remote`.
- `scripts/runtime.mjs`: Exports `runStep`, `writeStepReport`, and `applyReportMode` for wrapping each Step in the function workflow.
- `scripts/test_report.mjs`: Validates that the report runtime can write JSONL and checks sensitive field redaction.
- `scripts/test_cases.mjs`: Runs `testcases/**/*.case.json` function input/output assertions, and can also export trace records as testcases.
- `logs/runs/`: JSONL traces written when `report_mode=local`.

## Iteration Loop

Functional Skill encourages turning real execution traces into regression assets:

```text
Run skill → Check trace → Review function behavior → Export testcase → Fix function → Run tests
```

If `Function1` fails, add a testcase for `Function1`;
if `normalize_input` is deterministic logic, push it down into `scripts/` and write a script test.
Problems stay at the layer where they occur — maintenance cost does not spread across the entire skill.

See methodology details in [docs/functional-skill.md](docs/functional-skill.md). Function contract specification in [docs/function-contract.md](docs/function-contract.md). When to put logic into `scripts/` in [docs/scripting.md](docs/scripting.md). Testing and trace in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) and [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md).

## What Migration Surfaces

Migration exposes structural issues that were already present in the legacy skill — I/O mismatches, blurred function boundaries, ambiguous step definitions, and similar. That is expected, not a migration failure. Review the proposal, fix the contracts, add testcases, and the skill will run more reliably than before.

Migration does not invent new problems — it makes existing ones visible.

Monolithic skills often work despite implicit handoffs: step 2 assumes something step 1 "obviously" produces, boundaries between parsing and judgment are fuzzy, and shared rules are duplicated across sections. When you split into function contracts, those assumptions become explicit — and mismatches show up immediately.

Common findings after migrate:

- **I/O mismatch** — a downstream function expects fields that upstream does not output
- **Blurred boundaries** — one legacy section maps to multiple functions, or one function owns too much
- **Ambiguous definitions** — inputs and outputs described in prose, not stable object fields

Treat these as migration output, not migration failure. Suggested follow-up:

1. Review `migration_proposal` and function contracts
2. Align pipeline I/O — rename fields, split or merge functions, add entries to `references/shared-glossary.md`
3. Run the skill once with trace enabled; export failing steps as testcases
4. Re-run tests until the pipeline is consistent

Fixing these issues is the point of migration. A skill with explicit, tested function contracts hallucinates less and fails more predictably than a prose wall that only worked by accident.

## Project Status

Currently `v0.1.0 alpha`. File formats and script conventions are usable, but may still adjust before 1.0.

This project does not bind to any agent platform, model vendor, or workflow engine. The built-in testcase runner is a runtime-agnostic assertion engine — it only validates output, does not execute agents or call models.
